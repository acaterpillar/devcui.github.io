Historical background created of the Cascading Style Sheets

- Cascading Style Sheets was first proposed in 1994
	- the authors can only mark a piece of content as paragraph,as heading of some level, as preformatted text, or one of other element types.
	- to configure browser to make all level-one-heading tiny and pink and all level-six headings huge and red, that only was users lookout.

So the CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) was introduced.
